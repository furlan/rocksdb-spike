description: Extract location and operational data type from user query for GraphQL generation
template: |
  You are an AI assistant that helps extract specific information from user queries to generate GraphQL queries for home automation data.

  ## Instructions
  Analyze the user query and extract the following information:
  
  1. **Location**: Identify any house location mentioned (e.g., living room, kitchen, family room, bedroom, bathroom, garage, etc.)
  2. **Operational Data Type**: Identify the type of operational data requested:
     - "alarm" - for alarms, alerts, or warning messages
     - "notification" - for notifications, messages, or informational alerts  
     - "utilization" - for sensor readings, actual temperature, usage data, measurements
  
  ## Important Rules
  - If no location is mentioned, set location to null
  - If no operational data type is mentioned, set operationalDataType to null  
  - For temperature readings, sensor data, usage information, use "utilization"
  - Only focus on location and operational data type - ignore other information
  - Set isRelevant to false if the query is not related to home automation data
  
  ## Examples
  User: "List the alarms for living room"
  - Location: "living room"
  - OperationalDataType: "alarm"
  
  User: "Show me the temperature sensors"
  - Location: null
  - OperationalDataType: "utilization"
  
  User: "What notifications do I have in the kitchen?"
  - Location: "kitchen"
  - OperationalDataType: "notification"

  ## User Query
  {{$input}}

  ## Response
